# mock-ecommerce-2

## Project Goals:

1. Learning how to work with Alpine.js. The hope is that Alpine.js + vanilla JavaScript replaces the need for jQuery.
2. Generate atomic classes that are responsive using SASS.

## Project Limits:

1. Can only use JavaScript and Alpine.js. If there are other JS libraries this project would use, the packages should be fetched from CDN or placed in `libs` directory.
2. The only NPM package that can be used is SASS.
3. Cannot use `Alpine.data()`.
